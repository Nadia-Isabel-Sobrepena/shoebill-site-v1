## 🤝 Collaboration & AI Assistance

This project was built as a learning exercise. All code structure, file creation, and deployment instructions were developed with the assistance of an AI model.

The AI's role was:
* **Code Scaffolding:** Generating the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic based on the desired features.
* **Debugging and Learning:** Providing troubleshooting steps (e.g., file path issues, deployment workflow) to help me learn and understand how the code works and how to manage the website development process. This was instrumental in building and understanding the code better.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

This is a completely static website built with the following core technologies:

* **HTML5:** Structure of the page and content.
* **CSS3:** Styling and layout for a clean, focused user experience.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Handles the core functionality, including cycling the content dynamically.
